There are only two kinds of people who build and use frankenmechs: Rich snobby people who want unique battlemechs and are able to fuse two or more different machines and optimize them to the point they may be better than the parts they derived. The other are desperate people who have no choice, no parts to repair individual 'Mechs, but have lots of broken machines that may fix each other when assembled. The best kind of Pirate tech!

This MOD is all about the later desperate people, Pirates and Periphery states who need 'Mechs despite having no means to repair them properly. The emphasis on light battlemechs is due to these being the most commonly used by said factions. You can't make some frankenmech of an Atlas + Annihilator when they barely have any Atlas, imagine an Annihilator. So if you heard about some famous FrankenMech, and it is not on this MOD, maybe someone else will make them. Not me. And I have no idea about advanced rules for making frankenmechs, but I tried to make them logical in tonnage/weapons/performance sense.

Introduces a few FrankenMechs and variants: 25T Locust Gunhed (LCT-GUN), 30T Termite (SDR-FLE), 30T Javelin (JVN-10NF), 35T Jallinder (JVN-SHD), 40T Cicada CDA-TR4SH,  50T Hunhunchee (HBK-BNC), 65T Catapult (CPLT-C1K2), 75T Black Marauder (MAD-DRK1), 85T Urbinator (CRG-UM). Frankenmech chassis are exclusive to Pirates and Periphery, and a few unorthodox field refits (JVN-10NF & CPLT-C1K2) can be found in Independents and some Great Houses. See images for +details for weapons hardpoints.

This is YAML compatible, but not dependent. Said that, it is the YAML quirk system that makes those aberrations a bit closer to the reality found in the Periphery, badly assembled and full of defects. Without the quirks, they are better than their counterparts, and they should only be better with lots of investment and lostech.

Ignore any warnings conflict with YAML.  The file "Javelin_HPS.uasset" is almost identical on both MODs, so it won't matter who overrides who.

There are a few differences between the vanilla and YAML 'Mech properties (armour, structure, speed, heatsink, etc) aside from the quirk modifiers, but I won't detail them here. Those differences are not bugs. The FrankenMechs that are not supposed to use jumpjets have their jump flare animation f#c# up. That's also not a bug. I know people can just remove the quirk in the JSON file, but they won't remove that animation.

I know some of these battlemechs will offend a few people's taste and if they like to remove those, or modify others, you can download the MW5 Unreal Engine source files of this MOD below and do whatever you want.

A reminder: My potato computer is barely able to run MW5 Unreal Engine and this MOD is an amateur work and there are a few wrong blender/Unreal Engine modeling stuff I did because it is the only way I know how to do it. All modified models were extracted from MW5 Unreal Engine editor, with the exception of the Black Marauder mouth which I recreated from the model of 3D artist Bohdan Lvov's Fire-Coughing Mechanical Graboid Ass Blaser (https://www.artstation.com/artwork/QzmWeL) while learning Blender. The polygon count for each Level of Details (LOD) of my models are a bit higher than the standard MW5 model, but they run fine in my laptop which is low-end spec.

In the beginning, I thought about doing some missions a la Harebrained Schemes BATTLETECH - Tournament of Champions, where the player fights pirates with Urbanmechs and the final duel the pirates cheat with Urbinators. Sorry, but I won't. Too many crashes on Unreal Engine and no time. I will put my PayPal for donations here just to remind me to not outright abandon this MOD and try to give minimum support in case something goes terrible wrong. If you like this and feel generous donate something. I was very close to not even finishing it after working months on it... when they say you need SSD drives to run Unreal, they are not kidding (this almost killed my laptop).

- Gunhed LCT-GUN:
The Locust Gunhed, also known as Mosquito, or Vespa, or Lancer, or Spearhead, and many other names, is a very modified LCT-3V with its entire left torso & arm weapon system made from a "FOUND" Marauder-II cannon turret. By not having the actual Marauder II battlemech, pirates had to install on what they have plenty, carcasses of Locusts. That was only possible as the cannon has its own gyros and stabilizers used to compensate for the recoil shots, and now it also helps the 'Mech be upright and balanced. This kind of pirate tech practice eventually gave outlaws of Tortuga enough knowhow to produce their own mechs (Brigand).

- Termite SDR-FLE:
Without spare parts to repair what would be considered unsalvageable Spider 'Mechs, pirates used crippled Flea 'Mechs they were also unable to fully fix it. All jump jets were removed, the destroyed arms replaced by hooks, and with the smaller GM 120 engine, the Termite 'Mech is only able to achieve half the speed it had before. To compensate for these shortcomings, a MASC system was installed (where do Pirates get these rare things) and bigger weapons were installed.

- Javelin JVN-10NF: 
In 2751 Stormvanger Assemblies introduced the Javelin as a recon ’Mech with the firepower to survive being spotted. By the opening shots of the First Succession War, the Javelin had not yet been fully integrated into most regiments, but centuries of warfare have proven the reliability of the design. Despite the destruction of its only production facility, the Javelin remains a popular ’Mech. But in the periphery, Javelins in pristine condition are hard to maintain, so technicians there (mostly pirates) often mend broken chassis from JVN-10N and JVN-10F together to make this new variant. It somewhat resembles the original JVN-10A, but worse.

- Jallinder JVN-SHD: 
In 2999, a nameless genius mechtech/engineer, and minor noble from the Magistracy of Canopus had a vision of a 35T hero mech (Hollander) fighting against assault mechs coming from beyond the Inner Sphere. She spent all her family fortune to build a similar mech, pushing the limits of what a Javelin chassis can sustain to fit the super rare gauss rifle with cannon parts from a Shadow Hawk . Before her assassination, she gave all her knowledge on how to build FrankenMechs in a detailed compendium to all Periphery realms inhabitants, and pirates loved it!

- Cicada CDA-TR4SH:
Pirates "FOUND" a cache of equipments and weapons' refit kit for all kinds of Cicadas, 2A, 3C, and even missile pods for an experimental Cicada. So, they crammed all those weapons into some damaged CDA-2B to make the best Cicada ever! Sadly, the PPC was too heavy and it was replaced by another flamer, and the engine was downgraded to a smaller VOX 280 engine made for a CDA-3C variant.

- HunHunchee HBK-BNC: 
Introduced in 2572, the Hunchback is a medium-to-short-range brawler that rose to prominence during the many urban battles of the Reunification War. Widely known for its street-fighting abilities, pirates being pirates have put one Banshee arm to increase its fighting powers. It only added stress to the chassis, weakening the structure on that side. It's so unbalanced, its gyro can barely keep up with all movements.

- Catapult CPLT-C1K2: 
The Hollis Incorporated Catapult BattleMech is a state-of-the-art machine. With the appearance of the K2 variant, and the lack of industries to build new Catapults, desperate people start to fit half of K2 loadouts from destroyed mechs into more common broken Catalpults like the C1. This practice is especially true for the Free Rasalhague Republic and Pirates fighting along the border of the Draconis Combine even after the Catapult production was resumed.

- Black Marauder MAD-DRK1: 
Throughout the Succession Wars there were rumors of strange events and inexplicable carnage, all related to Black Marauders, some heavily modified version of the 3R variant with a more menacing-looking appearance. They may look like a Marauder 'Mech, but they are not normal machines; they are malevolent demonic entities that serve Chaos to spread death and fear on battlefields; to eat the souls of the fallen. There are no serial numbers nor any other factory markings to tell how many Marauders were cursed on their conversion. As for their purpose: in4%7@#$%* b100#sh3d f0# Dª#K1.

- Urbinator CGR-UM:
Without easy access to new refit kits to repair and upgrade the many broken CGR-1A1 Chargers, pirates manage to undo its shortcomings by fixing it with UrbanMech parts. Sure many subsystems were disabled, removed, and simply don't work anymore even if repaired, all to fit the unorthodox parts, and it kinda worked. Most energy connections were removed/broken from the chassis in favor of ballistic systems, and the right arm lost its hand, hand actuators, and most of its myormers to give space for the installation of the ballistic arm and ammunition feed system. It is bit overtonnage, full of system problems but it walks faster than a UrbanMech and shoots.

- Battlemaster BLR-KNT:
First built for the Star League in 2633 by Hollis Industries, the BattleMaster is one of the most iconic chassis of its time. This model of the BattleMaster is a very downgraded version of the BLR-1G 'Mech. Easier to maintain as it removes the missiles and PPC for more medium lasers and has a sword.
